## Hey there! üëã

I'm a **Cybersecurity Consultant** passionate about exploring every angle of digital security. At the moment, I‚Äôm dedicated to building an expansive, next-generation knowledge repository at [CyberLibrary](https://www.cyberlibrary.fr) ‚Äî a resource designed as a more holistic, deeply structured alternative to something like HackTricks and all the awesome repositories.

### What‚Äôs CyberLibrary?

**CyberLibrary** is your comprehensive guide to the entire cybersecurity ecosystem. It goes beyond just offensive or defensive tactics, encompassing every layer and sub-discipline in a cohesive, ever-evolving resource.

**Key Themes:**

- **Foundations:** Delve into core security principles, ethical considerations, human factors, and the historical evolution of cybersecurity.
- **Offensive:** Learn about ethical hacking methodologies, reconnaissance techniques, network exploitation, and red/purple teaming strategies.
- **Defensive:** Discover proactive preparation, continuous monitoring, incident response, recovery planning, and post-incident improvement.
- **Governance:** Understand the frameworks, policies, compliance standards, and strategic decision-making that keep organizations secure at the top level.
- **Career:** Explore roles, career paths, professional development, certifications, and how to grow and succeed in the cybersecurity industry.
- **Technology:** Unpack the fundamentals of computing, networks, cryptography, data management, and the technical building blocks that power digital infrastructures.

If you find this project useful, consider giving it a **star** ‚≠ê ‚Äî it really helps!

Thanks for stopping by üöÄ
